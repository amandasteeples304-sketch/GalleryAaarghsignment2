# GalleryAaarghsignment2

Immediately Olaf in Frozen 2 "When I Am Older", then I thought but what images??? I settled on seasonal flowers; so you would be going through the year as you went through the gallery. However, despite any kind of initial fear, I will always swallow it and just trap the spider by the cup (I hate spiders but I cannot bring myself to kill them because it isn't their fault that I don't like them and so I capture them and kick them out instead).

That leads me to my next point. I know that what I am being asked of are things that we have done throughout the week. Maybe not in the exact same content (images as arrays???? Mind blowing), but I know that I have been taught this and that I was successful in the breakout rooms. However, it turns out that my brain does not like to take things that I have learnt and apply it in different ways to what I have learnt. It thinks (like with the image arrays) that we have learnt x for this and this is all it can be done for. I know I have not been told it cannot be, and so why not try, however, my brain is new to this and thinks things can only be done if they have been shown that. I am saying this because while I have trapped the spider with the cup, this assignment has been an absolute struggle for me. As I said last week, no issue with the course or how its taught or the teachers, just my brains issues which will improve the more I do (promise).

I have a consistent fear that I haven't done the DOM. According the the youtube videos the DOM is there, but I have this nagging that it is not.

I have failed, and it was an incredibly miserable experience to do so as well. I know what I needed to do, I know what is wrong, but no matter how much I researched and tried to untagle, I just got more tangled. I don't think I have ever cried so frustratingly before.

The images do not fit to the page, I have not adjusted them to, I have not set the correct sizes. Infact, when I put the screen to the iphone 12 size, I completely lose my first image.

The images are not responsive to the design method, and the media query is not at all meaningful. I'm sure this is because of my image sizing issues.

The buttons. In the first assignment, I made a nice responsive header, and when you clicked on the segment you wanted, it took you to the area of a page. In the first assignment, I created a sound bar, and it played bird song when the button was pressed. It also paused. However, no matter what I did, I could not get a button to move images. There was always something not defined, or something had already been defined, or the images would disappear entirely. I feel like I want to connect them to the arrays, however, the internet guide for this also completely bamboozled me, and things disappeared, and I had error messages.

I left a lot of the broken or in some cases half code in, because right now, I feel that if I remove it, then it will remove other things (like the images), buut I do feel shame doing this.

I do think I put in an aria correctly, but I had dreams of using the keyboard shortcuts to maneuver the images! But how could I do this when I haven't even sorted out the buttons?

All in all, I am so incredibly disappointed in myself for this piece of work. I worked from thursday, all friday, all weekend, and it looks like I have done absolutely nothing. That's what annoys me the most. I have not been saving as I went along and uploading as I went along because I wasn't progressing with anything. Last assignment, I had a battle, I won it, I uploaded that version. I lost all my battles this time, which is why I have so few uploads.
